# @pfl-wsr/shadcn-ui

This is a comprehensive UI library that exports components from:

- [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [magicui](https://magicui.dev/)
- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/)

This package was extracted as a separate dependency because these component libraries are built with Tailwind CSS v3, while the primary version used throughout this workspace is Tailwind CSS v4.
